# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guideline

- Check your spelling and grammar.
  - Remove any trailing whitespace.
  - Contents should be listed according to the English Alphabet.
- Add a section if needed. Add the section title to Table of Contents.
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Does not contain items that are unmaintained, has archived repo, deprecated, or missing docs.

## Pull Request Process

- Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
- Add the link.

Template:
```
[project-name](http://example.com) - A short description ends with a period. `Language`
```

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
