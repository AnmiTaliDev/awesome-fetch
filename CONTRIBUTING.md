# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guideline

- Add one link per Pull Request.
  - Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
  - Write down the reason why the library is awesome.
- Add the link: 
 ```
- [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period. `Language`
```
  - Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
- Add a section if needed.
  - Add the section title to Table of Contents.
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
  - Contents should be listed according to the English Alphabet.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.
- Does not contain items that are unmaintained, has archived repo, deprecated, or missing docs.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
